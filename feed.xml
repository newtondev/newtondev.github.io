Us as DevOps/Ops Engineers are spoilt with the ease of configuration and not being able to see “behind the curtain”, especially on the master control plane. But there is always that nagging question as to how that works. Let’s peel away that curtain and go on a journey to... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How I passed the INE Certified Cloud Associate (ICCA) Exam</title><link href="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-i-passed-the-ine-certified-cloud-associate-icca-exam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I passed the INE Certified Cloud Associate (ICCA) Exam" /><published>2022-02-22T13:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-22T13:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-i-passed-the-ine-certified-cloud-associate-icca-exam/</id> <content src="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-i-passed-the-ine-certified-cloud-associate-icca-exam/" /> <author> <name>Craig Newton</name> </author> <category term="certifications" /> <summary> The ICCA certification courseware introduces you to the foundational and fundamental aspects of the cloud, and not just one specific provider but a high level approach to working with the methodology across a range of providers. Everything from provisioning cloud resources, the shared responsibility model, all the way through to security and compliance was covered by this course. The course ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Kubernetes on AWS — gotcha when using EFS</title><link href="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/kubernetes-on-aws-gotcha-when-using-efs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kubernetes on AWS — gotcha when using EFS" /><published>2022-02-22T13:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-22T13:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://newtondev.github.io/posts/kubernetes-on-aws-gotcha-when-using-efs/</id> <content src="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/kubernetes-on-aws-gotcha-when-using-efs/" /> <author> <name>Craig Newton</name> </author> <category term="kubernetes" /> <category term="aws" /> <summary> I was happily migrating a lot of applications over to EKS when my pods went into an Init state. Panic set in and I was having a look around at what the problem could be (what is it this time, I said to myself). For this specific Kubernetes cluster I was using a single EFS volume for all my deployments into quite a few separate namespaces. The problem I eventually faced was that when you crea... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to run a Kubernetes cron job manually as a one time job</title><link href="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-to-run-a-kubernetes-cron-job-manually-as-a-one-time-job/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to run a Kubernetes cron job manually as a one time job" /><published>2020-05-28T14:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2020-05-28T14:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-to-run-a-kubernetes-cron-job-manually-as-a-one-time-job/</id> <content src="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/how-to-run-a-kubernetes-cron-job-manually-as-a-one-time-job/" /> <author> <name>Craig Newton</name> </author> <category term="kubernetes" /> <summary> I recently had to create a cron job in Kubernetes that would run a data archive script that would archive the immutable MySQL table data for transactions for the previous day and upload the result to AWS S3. The job failed today as there was a network connectivity issue to the database and my code tried 3 times and then gave up for today. I then needed to have the job execute so I could have... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Public and Private Istio Ingress Gateways on AWS</title><link href="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/public-and-private-istio-ingress-gateways-on-aws/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Public and Private Istio Ingress Gateways on AWS" /><published>2019-08-30T14:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2019-08-30T14:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://newtondev.github.io/posts/public-and-private-istio-ingress-gateways-on-aws/</id> <content src="https://newtondev.github.io/posts/public-and-private-istio-ingress-gateways-on-aws/" /> <author> <name>Craig Newton</name> </author> <category term="kubernetes" /> <category term="aws" /> <summary> By default, istio creates a service with a publicly accessible classic load balancer (ELB). However, there are times where we only want access from our internal network or a network we are connected to via a secure VPN. To achieve this we need a copy of our current ingressgateway service and deployment configuration. The command below will output our current configuration to a file: kubect... </summary> </entry> </feed>
