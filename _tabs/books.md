Thanks to its extensive support for managing hundreds of containers that run cloud-native applications, Kubernetes is the most popular open source container orchestration platform that makes cluster management easy. This workshop adopts a practical approach to get you acquainted with the Kubernetes environment and its applications.

Starting with an introduction to the fundamentals of Kubernetes, you’ll install and set up your Kubernetes environment. You’ll understand how to write YAML files and deploy your first simple web application container using Pod. You’ll then assign human-friendly names to Pods, explore various Kubernetes entities and functions, and discover when to use them. As you work through the chapters, this Kubernetes book will show you how you can make full-scale use of Kubernetes by applying a variety of techniques for designing components and deploying clusters. You’ll also get to grips with security policies for limiting access to certain functions inside the cluster. Toward the end of the book, you’ll get a rundown of Kubernetes advanced features for building your own controller and upgrading to a Kubernetes cluster without downtime.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to manage containers and run cloud-based applications efficiently using Kubernetes.

No doubt Docker Containers are the future of highly-scalable software systems and have cost and runtime efficient supporting infrastructure. But learning it might look complex as it comes with many technicalities. This is where The Docker Workshop will help you.

Through this workshop, you’ll quickly learn how to work with containers and Docker with the help of practical activities. 

The workshop starts with Docker containers, enabling you to understand how it works. You’ll run third party Docker images and also create your own images using Dockerfiles and multi-stage Dockerfiles. Next, you’ll create environments for Docker images, and expedite your deployment and testing process with Continuous Integration. Moving ahead, you’ll tap into interesting topics and learn how to implement production-ready environments using Docker Swarm. You’ll also apply best practices to secure Docker images and to ensure that production environments are running at maximum capacity. Towards the end, you’ll gather skills to successfully move Docker from development to testing, and then into production. While doing so, you’ll learn how to troubleshoot issues, clear up resource bottlenecks and optimize the performance of services.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to utilize Docker containers in real-world use cases.

# Machine Learning on Kubernetes

![Machine Learning on Kubernetes](/assets/img/machine_learning_on_kubernetes_packt_book_small.jpg)

MLOps is an emerging field that aims to bring repeatability, automation, and standardization of the software engineering domain to data science and machine learning engineering. By implementing MLOps with Kubernetes, data scientists, IT professionals, and data engineers can collaborate and build machine learning solutions that deliver business value for their organization.

You'll begin by understanding the different components of a machine learning project. Then, you'll design and build a practical end-to-end machine learning project using open source software. As you progress, you'll understand the basics of MLOps and the value it can bring to machine learning projects. You will also gain experience in building, configuring, and using an open source, containerized machine learning platform. In later chapters, you will prepare data, build and deploy machine learning models, and automate workflow tasks using the same platform. Finally, the exercises in this book will help you get hands-on experience in Kubernetes and open source tools, such as JupyterHub, MLflow, and Airflow.

By the end of this book, you'll have learned how to effectively build, train, and deploy a machine learning model using the machine learning platform you built.
